1- What is S3?

- S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon s3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

- S3 is a safe place to store your files.
- It is Object-based storage.
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

2- SImple Storage Service

- S3 is object-based - i.e. allows you to upload files.
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
- There is unlimited storage.
- Files are stored in Buckets.
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
- When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload is successful.

3- S3 is a Simple Key Value Store

- S3 is Object based. Objects consist of the following.
    - Key (This is sim[ply the name of the object])
    - Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (important for versioning)
    - Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
    - Subresources:
        - Access control lists
        - Torrent

4- Data Consistency Model For S3

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
- In other words:
    - If you write a new file and read it inmediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data.
    - If you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file and read it inmediately, you may get the older version, or you may not. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.

5- Guarantees

- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.
- Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability
- Amazon Gßßuarantee 99.999999999% durability for s3 information. (Remember 11 x 9s).

6- Features

- Tiered Storage Available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- MFA Delete
- Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

7- Storage Classes/Tiers

- S3 Standard: 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundancy across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
- S3 AI: (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone AI: want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resiliance.
- S3 Intelligent Tiering - Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
- S3 Glacier: S3 Glaciar is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on promises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

8- Charges

- Charged for:
    - Storage.
    - Requests.
    - Storage Management Pricing.
    - Data Transfer Pricing.
    - Transfer Acceleration.
    - Cross region replication.

9- Transfer Acceleration

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an s3 bucket.
- Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

10- Security & Encryption

- By default, all newly created buckets are private. You can setup access control to your buckets using:
    - Bucket Policies
    - Access Control Lists
- S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be sent to another bucket and even another bucket in another account.
- Encryption in Transit is achieved by
    - SSL/TLS
- Encryption at Rest is achieved by
    - Server-side Encryption.
        - Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3).
        - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).
        - Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C).
    - Client-side Encryption.

11- Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object).
- Great backup tool.
- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
- Integrates with Lifecycle rules.
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.

12- Lifecycle Management

- Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers.
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions.
- Following actions can now be done:
    - Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class (30 days after the creation date)
    - Archive to the Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA, if relevant)
    - Permanetly deleted.

13- Cross Region Replication

- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.
- Regions must be unique.
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically.
- All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically.
- Delete markers are NOT replicated.
- Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.
