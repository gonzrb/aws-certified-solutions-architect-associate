1- What is S3?

- S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon s3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

- S3 is a safe place to store your files.
- It is Object-based storage.
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

2- SImple Storage Service

- S3 is object-based - i.e. allows you to upload files.
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
- There is unlimited storage.
- Files are stored in Buckets.
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
- When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload is successful.

3- S3 is a Simple Key Value Store

- S3 is Object based. Objects consist of the following.
    - Key (This is sim[ply the name of the object])
    - Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (important for versioning)
    - Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
    - Subresources:
        - Access control lists
        - Torrent

4- Data Consistency Model For S3

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
- In other words:
    - If you write a new file and read it inmediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data.
    - If you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file and read it inmediately, you may get the older version, or you may not. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.

5- Guarantees

- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.
- Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability
- Amazon Gßßuarantee 99.999999999% durability for s3 information. (Remember 11 x 9s).

6- Features

- Tiered Storage Available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- MFA Delete
- Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

7- S3 Storage Tiers/Classes

- S3 Standard: 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundancy across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
- S3 AI: (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone AI: want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resiliance.
- Glacier: Very cheap, but used for archival only. Expedited, Standard or Bulk. A Standard retrieval time takes 3 - 5 hours. 

8- S3 Charges

- Charged for:
    - Storage.
    - Requests.
    - Storage Management Pricing.
    - Data Transfer Pricing.
    - Transfer Acceleration.

9- What is Transfer Acceleration

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an s3 bucket.
- Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

10- Security & Encryption

- Control Access to buckets using either a bucket ACL or using Bucket Policies.
- By default buckets are private and all objects stored inside them are private.
- S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all request made to the s3 bucket. This can be done to another bucket. 
- In Transit Encryption
    - SSL/TLS
- At Rest Encryption
    - Client-side Encryption.
    - Server-side Encryption.
        - Server side encryption with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3).
        - Server side encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS).
        - Server side encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C).

11- Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object).
- Great backup tool.
- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.

12- Cross region replication

- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.
- Regions must be unique.
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically.
- You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining (at this time).
- Delete markers are NOT replicated.
- Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.
- Undestand what Cross Region Replication is at a high level.

13- Lifecycle Management, S3-IA and Glacier

- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions.
Following actiosn can now be done:
    - Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Acess Storage Class (30 days after the creation date)
    - Archive to the Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA, if relevant)
    - Permanetly deleted.
