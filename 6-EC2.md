1- What is EC2?

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quicly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

- EC2 Options

- On Demand - allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
- Reserved - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significat discount on the hourly charge for an instance, 1 Year or 3 Year Term.
- Spot - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
- Dedicated Hosts - Phisical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce cost by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

- On Demand

- Perfect for user that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

- Reserved Instances

- Applications with steady state or predictable usage
- Applications that require reserved capacity
- Users can make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
    - Standard Rls (Up to 75% off on-demand)
    - Convertible Rls (Up to 54$ off on-demand) feature the capability to change the attirbutes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
    - Scheduled Rls are available to launch within the time window you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.

- Spot Instances

- Applications that have flexible start and end times
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
- Users with an urgent need for large amount with computed capacity

- Dedicated Hosts

- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
- Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly).
- Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.

- EC2 Instance Types

- F1 - Field Programmable Gate Array - Genomic research, financial analytics, real-time video processing, big data, etc.
- I3 - High speed storage - NoSQL, DBs, Data Warehousing, etc
- G3 - Graphic Intensive - Video Encoding/ 3D Application Streaming
- H1 - High Disk, Thoughput - MapReduce-based workloads, distributed file system such as HDFS and MapR-FS
- T2 - Lowerst Cost, General Propose - Web Server/Small DBs
- D2 - Dense Storage - Fileservers/Data Warehousing/Hadoop
- R4 - Memory Optimized - Memory Intensive Apps/DBs
- M5 - General Purpose - Application Servers
- C5 - Compute Optimized - CPU Intensive Apps/DBs
- P3 - Graphics/General Purpose GPU - Machine Learning, Bit Coin Mining, etc.
- X1 - Memory Optimized - SAP HANA/Apache Spark, etc.
- Z1D - High compute capacity and a high memory footprint - IDeal for electronic design automation (EDA) and certain relational database workloads with high per-core licensing costs.
- A1 - Arm-based workloads - Scale out workloads such as web servers
- U-6tb1 - Bare Metal - Bare metal capabilities that eliminate virtualization overhead

- Security Groups

- A Security Group is a vritual firewall controllign traffict to your EC2 instance.
- All inbound traffict is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is allowed
- Changes to security groups take effect inmediately
- You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
- You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances
- Security Groups are stateful
- If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again
- You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists
- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules

- Volumes and Snapshots - Security

- Volumes exist on EBS
    - Virtual Hard Disk
- Snapshots exist on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
- Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
- If this is your first snapshot it might take soem time to create
- To create a snapshot from Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot
- However you can take a snap while the instance is running
- You can create AMI's from EBS-backed instances and snapshots
- You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type
- Volumes will ALWAYS be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance
- To move an EC2 volume from one AZ/Region to another, take a snap or an image of it, the copy it to the new AZ/Region
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encryopted automatically
- You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencryopted
    - These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public

- Placements Groups

- Three Types of Placement Groups:

- Clustered Placement Group: A cluster placement group is a grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Placement groups that need low network latency, high network thriughput, or both. Only certain instances can be lancuhed in to a Clustered Placement Group.
    - Low Network Latency/High Network Throughput.
- Spread placement group: A spread placement group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware. Spread placement group are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.
    - Individual Critical EC2 instances.
- Particioned Placement Group: When using partition placement groups, Amazon EC2 divides each group into logical segments called partitions. Amazon EC2 ensures that each partition within a placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and powert source. No two partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to isolate the impact of hardware failure within your application.
    - Multiple EC2 instances HDFS,HBase and Cassandra.

- A clustered placement group can't span multiple Available Zones.
- A spread placement and partitioned group can.
- The name you specifiy for a placement group must be unique within your AWS account.
- Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (Compute Optimized, GPU, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized).
- AWS recommed homogenous instances within clostered placement groups.
- You can't merge placement groups.
- You can't move an existing instance into a placement group. You can create an AMI from your existing instance, and then launch a new instance from the AMI into a placement group.
