1- What is EC2?

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quicly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements changes.

- EC2 Options

- On Demand - allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
- Reserved - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significat discount on the hourly charge for an instance, 1 Year or 3 Year Term.
- Spot - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
- Dedicated Hosts - Phisical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce cost by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

- On Demand

- Perfect for user that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

- Reserved Instances

- Applications with steady state or predictable usage
- Applications that require reserved capacity
- Users can make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
    - Standard Rls (Up to 75% off on-demand)
    - Convertible Rls (Up to 54$ off on-demand) feature the capability to change the attirbutes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
    - Scheduled Rls are available to launch within the time window you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.

- Spot Instances

- Applications that have flexible start and end times
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
- Users with an urgent need for large amount with computed capacity

- Dedicated Hosts

- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
- Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly).
- Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.
