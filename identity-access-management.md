- Identity Access Management Consists of the following:
    - Users
    - Groups
    - Roles
    - Policies

- IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time.
- The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.
- New Users have NO permissions when first created.
- New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created.
- These are not the same as a password. You cannot use the Access key ID & Secret Access Key to Login in to the console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line however.
- You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So, save them in a secure location.
- Always setup Multifactor Authentification on your root account.
- You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
